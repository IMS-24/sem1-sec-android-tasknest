## Decisions

### Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose offers a modern, declarative approach to building UIs, enabling faster development with fewer lines of
code. It aligns with Kotlinâ€™s language features and enhances maintainability and scalability for the Android app.

### .NET Backend

.NET provides robust tools for building scalable, high-performance backend services. Its integration with ASP.NET and
Entity Framework simplifies CRUD operations and database interactions, making it a suitable choice for a task management
application.

### Auth0

Auth0 streamlines authentication and authorization processes, offering secure and scalable identity management. It
allows for easy integration with the backend and supports multiple authentication providers, ensuring flexibility and
security for the platform.

## App Status

### Features Included

- User authentication via Auth0.
- Task creation, updating, and deletion.
- Attach files to tasks.
- Basic UI for managing tasks and user profiles.
- HTTPS encryption for secure data transfer.
- Device metadata retrieval for enhanced task tracking.
- GPS tracking for location-based task management.

### Work-in-Progress (WIP)


### Known Bugs

- UI performance issues with large task lists.

### Next Steps

- Resolve UI performance issues.
